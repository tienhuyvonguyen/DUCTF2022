With this challenge, firstly we need to look around with google images but the result is like an osean.
So I decided to scan for information in the picture because luckily they have some for me.
After scanning, we have some kind of a beer brand name SuperCellars, switch to google.com and search for SuperCellars, we have this (https://supercellars.com.au/)
Looking for store locator, we can see that almost every store is located in Australia, and we already known that DUCTF is from Australia, so we can narrow down the target we want to looking for
1 more thing, there are like many store we need to check out in Street view mode so it will take like an hour so I decided to look back with what I already have 1 more time.
I noticed that when I scanning for the content in the picture, there are a billboard about breakfast in something start with Rairsona, sound weird but we could try 1 letter by 1
I start with map.google.com and search for "SuperCellars R" and we can narrow down the target from like 30 to 4.
Looking around for each of 4 stores, we can see that at Supper Cellars Rawson street, location in Epping Hotel bottle shop have the matching picture with the picture we been provided, and they ask for where the picture been taken
So, FLAG: DUCTF{Epping Hotel}
